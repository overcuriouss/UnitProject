    <p>Personally I **** looked into github before to grab mods *** video games such as minecraft, so it&apos;s not a completely ***** sight ** me. Still the ****** ******** of my own stuff is odd as anything new is. I managed to figure it *** quickly because (like **** sites) *** setup to be **** to ********** *** find what you need on. The process of creating the html document was annoying ** ***** because I *** to find a ******* that would let me do ** without paying. I mean it makes ***** that ** asks for money since HTML *** quite literally develop websites but **** ** was annoying. On *** of that trying ** figure *** how ** download the file ** an html file was equally as difficult. The coding ****** wasn&apos;t too difficult because the ******** exists, ******* me find ********* *** informational ****** to ***** me **** to do in a matter of minutes. *** idea of **** ****** *** **** ******** *** throughout this entire ******* I had to convince ****** ** **** start the work because it felt **** it would be something that causes all nighters. I was never able ** overcome this mental hurdle, but I was able to overcome the actual ******* ** coding. ***** *** it doesn&apos;t and I was **** ******** myself *** which certainly didn&apos;t look good *** me. Still I *** not expecting *** process behind ******* publishing to be so complex even for how simple the work ** did was. There were several ***** to go through just to get it processed *** then ****** with the internet. I applaud *** people behind websites and code because this is crazy complex.</p>
